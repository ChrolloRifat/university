#Haven of Codes

This repo contains:
1. programs that we were asked to write in the class
2. programs that we did in the CSE Lab
3. programs that were in the quiz
4. programs that are in the lab manuals
5. programs that are found randomly on the web
6. programs from exercise sections of books
7. programs that are just mind boggling or interesting
8. group projects
9. personal shenanigans
10. bullshits

*Beware: You should understand every line of these codes. If you don't understand, ask your mates, read the book, search the net. That's the whole point of it. Always remember, it is YOU who help yourself. Don't deprive yourself of the help. This repo is just a reference and a history of your hard works.*


PR: If you don't understand a certain line or logic in any of the programs, discuss it with me or any other fellow collaborators on this repo. Don't shy away from asking even the silliest thing. After all, I'm the person who wrote 8 * 8 = 16. So..yeah..don't be shy...
